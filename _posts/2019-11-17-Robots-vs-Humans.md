### What up with Humans?

When talking about Humans in this context I am not talking about humans as in you and me. I am referring to the file humans.txt often added to the root of websites. This particular file is not visible by default for visitors and it is only a basic .txt file that you need to search for to find. This file tells you about the author of the site and what technologies/languages where used in the making of this site and if there are other people that have contributed to the site in any way that should be credited.

This is of course not a must, but its an initiative to standardize the mentioning of every person involved in creating the site, so it will be appreciated by both authors and visitors. Providing this information in a .txt file is fast and does not add any strain on your site when it comes to efficiency and you will make everybody involved happy by having their names mentioned!

### And robots?...

One could guess that the robots.txt file would have information about any robots helping out in the making of the site, but that would be wrong and of course a bit preposterous. Robots cant make websites, right? Well they might, but that is not for me to discuss here. The file robots.txt is a file that is used to instruct web robots on how to index pages on your site. This means that you can decide what the search engines may index on your site by disallowing certain parts of your page for everyone or for specific search engines.

The robots.txt file has to be placed in the root of your page structure, otherwise the web crawler will assume that the site does not have a robots.txt file and will proceed to index everything.
