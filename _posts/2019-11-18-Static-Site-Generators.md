### Opinions of SSGs

I think SSGs are a bit of a double edged sword. The ease of creating a website with the push of a button can get you boxed in to the confines of that specific SSG set of rules and limitations. And it can also be hard to modify the design or functionality since you often need a deeper understanding of that particular framework to work out what's what. But at the same time the ease and speed of creating a page can be such a blessing! Even if you do have the know-how's to making a super advanced web app it might not be feasible due to time or budget constraints. If you just need a quick webpage without advanced database connections you should definitely take a closer look at SSGs before putting on your coding-cap and pouring those two cans of RedBull in your pot of coffee.

Another great thing about static sites is security. Since there are only simple static files the ways for a potential hacker to gain access to your web server is greatly reduced.

### What Types of Projects Are They Suitable For?

As I briefly mentioned above, static site generators are mainly best suited for project where you need a fast and secure yet elegant way of getting a webpage online. If you need dynamic content with database connections a static site is really not for you though. Maybe you are a Fortune 500 looking to launch a new product and want to get a showcase online or you just want to start a blog to share your thoughts on whatever subject that lies close to your heart. It really doesn't matter who you are, you can benefit from an SSG if you dont want all the bells and whistles and still want superior build speed, security, reliability and ease of maintenance.
